# TimeSeries-Forecasting
Time Series &amp; Forecasting project

We were given a time series dataset containing the
daily number of patients who visited a specialist surgery
from April 2015 to March 2019. We were tasked with
fitting various models to explain the data, and asked for
a prediction of at least 7 days for the surgery's
management team to estimate the number of patients
who will visit the surgery in the future.
For this problem, I plotted the time series and
performed some rudimentary analysis using R , and
decomposed the data to examine the underlying trend,
seasonality and error. I then experimented on the data
by fitting different models to explain the series and
analysed the effectiveness of each one. These models
include a baseline ( na√Øve ) model, extrapolation models
Single Exponential Smoothing (SES), Holt Linear and
Holt Winters ), simple and multiple linear regression,
and ARIMA s. After describing each model, I fitted it to
our data, extracted the required forecast, and
calculated the error statistics.
